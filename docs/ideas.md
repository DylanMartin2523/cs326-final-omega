#### Innovative Idea
Will have a user create an account and give their home address and can also possibly set a home mountain. This we will use to be able to show them the closest ski
resorts as well as recent weather at the resorts and other info about the mountian such as trail maps and elevation data. This is similar to Google Maps 
where you would just be able to type in ski resort and get some results but the focus is on the user and the best mountain experience for them based on weather as 
well as distance. 
#### Important Components
Some important components include:
- User page: where the user can set their home address and prefered mountains.
- Map page: where the user can see all of the closest mountains to their home location. Clicking on a location on the map brings up the mountain pane.
- Mountain Pane: This section will hold all of the data about the mountain like the weather, location, tailmap and altitude.
